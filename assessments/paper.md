title: Reflection Paper
description: Description of Course Paper
nav_order: 4
due_date: "Tuesday Mar 14, 11:00am EDT"
---

The structure of this class is designed to provide a broad survey of many topics in software engineering practice and research:

* Software Process
* Modularity and Design
* Mining Software Repositories
* Open Source
* Testing
* Continuous Integration
* Devops
* Expertise and knowledge sharing
* Security
* Software engineering in specific domains

The goal of the reflection paper is for you to select a topic of particular personal interest, identify five research articles (that are not required readings for this course), read them, and organize your reaction to the topic in a *reflection paper*. The reflection paper provides you to an opportunity to apply critical reasoning skills in the context of the research papers that we discuss in class, and to dig deeper into a topic of your own particular interest.

This is *not* a literature review: the goal with this paper is for you to provide some editorial critiques of the work and express your own opinions, rather than to provide a fair and direct summary of the contents of each paper. The expected length of the reflection paper is roughly 2,500 words.

There are three main deliverables for the reflection paper:
1. [Paper proposal]({{site.baseurl}}{% link assessments/paper-proposal.md %})
2. The reflection paper 
3. A short presentation in class of your findings

The objectives for the reflection paper are to:
* Compare and contrast different software testing and analysis approaches
* Critically analyze research projects
* Cultivate new ideas for research directions

Once you have selected the papers that you will respond to, consider one (or more) of the following prompts:
* What are common themes or goals between these papers? Do they share similar assumptions (in terms of how software is designed and tested)?
* How do these works complement each other?
* Based on your own experiences developing software, do you believe that the evaluations in these papers provide sufficient evidence to draw the conclusions that are claimed?
* If you have experience with other related works in software engineering, how do you think those works compare?
* Are there next-steps that you think could be applied to extend the ideas presented in these papers?
* Were there parts of some of these works that you thought were poorly explained, and could have been written in another way to be more accessible?

You should consider these prompts as jumping-off points: feel free to respond to one or more of these questions in your paper, or alternatively, something completely different. The most important part is that your paper should convey *your own reactions* to the six papers that you have selected --- demonstrating that you read the papers and thought about them. 

**This is an individual assignment**. The goal of this assignment is to provide your *personal* reflection to the topic of your choice. Papers that are substantially similar to each other (or to third-party content) will receive a score of 0, with no opportunity for a revision. If you have any questions or concerns of what constitutes plagiarism, please reach out to the instructor immediately. 

## Formatting
Feel free to use whatever word processing environment you prefer. We strongly encourage that you use some editor that will help you manage a bibliography --- like LaTeX + BibTex, or Word + Endnote.  Please clearly identify the one paper from the required reading list for the course plus the five additional papers that you intend to discuss --- one way to do that might be to include them in your bibliography, and cite them in the first paragraph of your paper. 

## Presentation
To share your experience with the rest of the class, prepare a lightning talk (8 minutes) that summarizes what you learned about this topic, and your reaction to it. The goal of the lightning talk is to share one or two things that you learned that were interesting to you: an open (or closed) problem in that research area, some methodology or tool that addresses a known problem, etc. The presentation will be graded entirely on a "you did it" or "you didn't" basis, as long as you show up at the assigned time and talk about the topic.

## Grading
Your reflection paper will be graded on the scale of (Unacceptable, Check-, Check, Check+). The criteria for each grade are described below.

To receive the grade of **Check**, the paper/presentation must satisfy all of these criteria:
* The paper is approximately 2,500 words (plus or minus a few hundred is OK; if you are far short of 2,500 you might consider deepening your exploration; if you are far over 2,500 words, you might consider condensing your efforts)
* The paper responds to one of the articles on the course's required reading list, plus the five articles that were approved by the course staff via the [paper proposal]({{site.baseurl}}{% link assessments/paper-proposal.md %})
* The paper demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the papers selected
* The paper uses relevant examples from the papers discussed in class to support and describe your reactions to the works
* The paper uses language that is understandable, and generally does not distract from the content of the work
* The presentation describes a concept related to the paper.

To receive the grade of **Check-**, the paper must satisfy all of these criteria:
* The paper is between 1,500-2,500 words
* The paper responds to one of the articles on the course's required reading list, plus the five articles that were approved by the course staff via the [paper proposal]({{site.baseurl}}{% link assessments/paper-proposal.md %})
* The paper demonstrates a limited understanding of the papers selected, focusing primarily on summarizing the content of the papers without demonstration of higher-level understanding of them

Submissions that do not meet the criteria for "Check-" will receive the grade of "Unacceptable." Submissions that exceed the qualities outlined for "Check" (e.g. include additional, insightful connections between the papers discussed in class and other works, uses particularly sophisticated and engaging language, and generally demonstrates an exceptional and thorough understanding of the selected papers) may receive the grade of "Check+". As per the course policies, note that a grade of "Check" is sufficient to receive an A in the class.

## Submission
Submit your paper on Canvas. The paper is due on March 14 at 11:00am. No late submissions will be accepted. Presentations will occur in-class on March 14 and 16.

## Revision
Students who make a good faith effort on the paper (e.g. submit a document on time that is conformant to the general guidelines explained above), and receive a grade below "Check" will receive detailed feedback on their paper, and be allowed to resubmit the paper (within 2 weeks), under the understanding that the *highest* grade of the submissions will be used. Students who receive a grade of "Check" may *not* resubmit their work to attempt to achieve a "Check+" (again, note that in this situation, this would have no impact on your course grade).
